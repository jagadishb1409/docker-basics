# Docker Basics

Getting started with Docker

Docker is a popular platform for developers to create, deploy and run applications within containers. 
Containers offer an isolated and lightweight environment for applications to run, which makes it easier to manage and deploy applications in various environments.

Here are the steps to get started with Docker on Windows:

1. Install Docker Desktop: Download and install the Docker Desktop application from the Docker website. 
It will include both the Docker Engine and Docker CLI, which are required to run containers.

2. Run Docker on Windows: After installing Docker Desktop, launch the application and log in to your Docker account. 
You should see the Docker whale icon in your system tray, indicating that Docker is running.

3. Pull an Image: Docker images are pre-built applications that you can use as a starting point to create your own containers. 
To get started, pull a popular image such as the "Hello World" image by running the following command in a Command Prompt or Windows Terminal window:

````console
docker pull hello-world
````

4. Run a Container: Once you have pulled an image, you can run it as a container. Run the following command to start the "Hello World" container:

````console
docker run hello-world
````

5. Explore Docker Hub: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?q=" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> is a repository for Docker images. 
You can find images for a wide range of applications, from databases to web servers, and even development tools. Browse the Docker Hub to find the images you need for your project.

6. Create your own Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. 
You can use a Dockerfile to define the environment your application needs to run, including the software and libraries it requires.

7. Build your Image: Use the 'docker build' command to build an image from your Dockerfile. 
This will create a new image with the changes you specified in your Dockerfile.

With these basic steps, you are now ready to start using Docker on Windows. 
From here, you can explore the many features and benefits of Docker, including scaling, networking, and volumes. Happy containerizing!
